## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

1. Go to the `frontend/` folder.

2. Install dependencies:

npm install

    Create a .env file in the frontend/ folder:

VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

    Start the frontend:

npm run dev

It will run at http://localhost:5173 (or similar).
ðŸ”— Supabase Auth Integration

    The app checks if the user is logged in.

    If logged in, they can go to the main app (/body route).

    If not, they are asked to log in or sign up.

    After logging in, user info is used to save and fetch their data.

âœ… To-Do

    Add deployment instructions once deployed (coming soon).
